# API-Testing-with-Postman
This project demonstrates my skills in REST API testing using Postman, utilizing the free public API provided by https://reqres.in. The goal was to perform and validate complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations by simulating real-world scenarios for a user management system.

✔️ Create – Send POST requests to create new users

📖 Read – Use GET requests to retrieve user details

🔄 Update – Modify existing user data using PUT/PATCH requests

❌ Delete – Send DELETE requests to remove a user
